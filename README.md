This is my **NVim** configs and plugins

**STEP 1:** cd on your system configs

```bash
cd ~/.config/ # or wherever there is
```
**STEP 2:** run these in the command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnowyDevo/nvim_config.git nvim
```
If there is any conflicts, make sure your `~/.config/nvim` directory is empty.
To do all in one line, just copy paste this command:

> `cd ~/.config/ ; rm -r nvim ; git clone https://github.com/SnowyDevo/nvim_config.git nvim`

Enjoy!
